# Smart-Pump-for-EV-sub-system-cooling
This project presents a complete framework intended to transform the cooling systems of electric vehicles (EVs) by use of sophisticated brushless direct current (BLDC) motor management schemes. The increasing demand for electric vehicles (EVs) demands effective thermal management in order to guarantee optimal performance and component longevity. Our process starts by incorporating a complex communication interface that makes use of the Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol. Through the use of this interface, the microcontroller can easily receive fake temperature data from sensors that have been positioned strategically. This makes it possible to monitor the thermal dynamics of the EV subsystem in real time. Robust and dependable communication is ensured by the use of CAN, which is crucial for preserving system integrity in harsh automotive conditions. Our method's key component is the dynamic modulation of BLDC motor speed, which is essential for controlling coolant flow and efficiently handling thermal loads. Our control method uses Hall sensor inputs to track the motor's location and speed precisely, allowing for adaptive control strategies that are specific to a given thermal environment. By using trapezoidal commutation logic, motor responsiveness and efficiency are further improved, and energy consumption is maximized while thermal stress on system components is reduced. By means of meticulous experimentation and analysis, we verify the effectiveness of our methodology in many operational scenarios. Testing conducted in real-world, EV-like settings shows notable gains in cooling system dependability, efficiency, and energy savings. Our project highlights how BLDC motor control techniques can be revolutionary in resolving the thermal issues that come with electric vehicles. Our study advances the state-of-the-art in electric vehicle thermal management, which advances sustainable transportation innovation. The knowledge gathered from this study will help shape future advancements in electric vehicle (EV) cooling systems, which will speed up the shift to more environmentally friendly automobiles.
